  description = #LOC_SPO_manufacturer_description//Originally founded after the explosive (figurative and literal) discovery of new ways of harnessing the infinite power of the atom. Since then, Applied Atomiks has ceaselessly sought to develop and market applications of this new technology. Proponents defend the company, stating they just havent found their niche yet, while detractors grow ever more numerous following the disasterous rollout of their new Atomik Toaster (it toasts toast very, very quickly). Seeking to redeem their public image, Applied Atomiks has turned to the aerospace industry amidst rumors of a revolutionary new engine design.
