    // MANUFACTURERS
    #LOC_SPO_manufacturer_title = Applied Atomiks
    #LOC_SPO_manufacturer_description = Originally founded after the explosive (figurative and literal) discovery of new ways of harnessing the infinite power of the atom. Since then, Applied Atomiks has ceaselessly sought to develop and market applications of this new technology. Proponents defend the company, stating they just havent found their niche yet, while detractors grow ever more numerous following the disasterous rollout of their new Atomik Toaster (it toasts toast very, very quickly). Seeking to redeem their public image, Applied Atomiks has turned to the aerospace industry amidst rumors of a revolutionary new engine design.

	#LOC_SPO_5mOrion_name = AA-64 "Orion" Nuclear Pulse Propulsion Engine
	#LOC_SPO_5mOrion_desc = After the declassification of one or two explosive mishaps during the creation of the venerable LV-N, Applied Atomiks researchers were struck not by the size of the craters that were left, but by how far the debris flew, and wondered "What if we were to do that deliberately?" The Orion is the result, following decades of research into what makes LV-N cores explode, how to do it reliably, and how to minaturize the devices to allow enough of them to be carried to get anywhere worthwhile.

More a vending machine than a fuel tank, the Orion magazine holds an external supply of extra pulse units, and the machinery to transfer them to an attached Orion drive
